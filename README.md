# Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset and the model is trained using various supervised machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset widely used in machine learning and statistics. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.

In this project:

- We explore the data with visualizations.
- We preprocess the data and split it into training and test sets.
- We apply Logistic Regression (or another algorithm of your choice) to build the classification model.
- We evaluate the model performance using a confusion matrix and calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- We use visualizations such as heatmaps to represent the confusion matrix.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy: Overall, how often the classifier is correct.
- Precision: Out of the predicted positive examples, how many are truly positive.
- Recall: Out of the actual positive examples, how many were correctly predicted.
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- Confusion Matrix: A heatmap was used to visualize the results.

## Results

- The model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test data.
- Precision and recall were balanced, with minimal misclassification between the species.
- The confusion matrix indicates strong performance, especially in classifying Setosa with 100% accuracy.
